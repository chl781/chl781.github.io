		<h4>I am a 5th year PhD student at <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://www.nicolasgarciat.com/" target="_blank">Nicolas Gracia Trillos</a>. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Math from <a href="http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/mathen/" target="_blank">Zhejiang University</a> in 2019. My thesis is about a Minsum packing optimization problem supervised by Professor <a href=https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0003325 target="_blank">Zhiyi Tan</a>. I got my master's degree in Statistics from <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> in 2020.

  In my academic pursuits, I am interested in exploring topology and geometric perspectives to gain a deeper understanding of complex problems. This interest further motivates my study of algorithms and their concrete mathematical formulations. Additionally, I am passionate about designing fast and interpretable algorithms for statistical problems. My academic background is a diverse blend of mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

		One of my ongoing research lines involves the calculus of variation and PDEs when dealing with the spectral manifold clustering problem. The philosophy is to find the continuum analog that can work as an ideal population-level counterpart in a geometric or calculation setting. From a mathematical view of point, this line considers the clustering and graph cut problem from a continuum limit of a random geometric graph. This perspective allows discussing the convergence rate and the nature of the algorithm, and provide strong links between learning problems and geometric problems studied in the mathematics literature. Recently, I also utilize the geometric tool to study the Neural Network in order to provide a more efficient algorithm to explain it.

My 

<br><br>
One my previous line of my research lay in an intersection between Optimization and Statistics. I was interested in designing algorithms that are both efficient and interpretable for statisticians. For example, one of my works is finding a coordinate-wise update method to solve Non-Negative Least Squares problems; the algorithm is both computationally efficient without any explicit dependence on  and sparse.

I am also interested in learning a connection between adversarial learning and regularization. For example, we captured a series of adversarial problems connecting the Strongly contamination model and $l_2$ contamination model. In my research, we can use a PDEs method to track the solution of the adversarial optimization problem, which can capture an entire ensemble of problems. However, the problem might face divergence some time. I am also interested in developing a topological description of the collapse of PDEs.

One line of my research involves the calculus of variation and PDEs when dealing with the spectral manifold clustering problem. The philosophy is to find the continuum analog that can work as an ideal population-level counterpart in a geometric or calculation setting. In particular, my research mainly focuses on identifying points from multiple intersecting manifolds. From a mathematical view of point, this line is based on the continuum limit of a random geometric graph, and then algorithms can be designed based on geometric intuition.
<br><br>
The other line of my research lies in an intersection among optimization, adversarial learning, and persistent homology, studying a change of topology phenomenon in these problems. We can use PDEs to track the solution of the adversarial optimization problem, solving an entire ensemble of problems. However, this change of parameters might lead to divergence some time, suggesting a topological change. In TDA, topological change is the basis of the method, and the collapse of features will identify significance. Further, a decay of topology appears widely in the optimization problem. For example, sparsity of solution will usually mean a change of topology. Therefore, it is essential to develop a combined description and commonness of the topological structures among these studies.

		
		My research interests include graph, machine learning and convex optimization. Currently, I am working on a general framework for manifold clustering with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pengfei_He14" target="_blank">Pengfei He</a> and Professor <a href="https://www.nicolasgarciat.com/" target="_blank">Nicolas Gracia Trillos</a>. Also, I am exploring a minimax problem with Professor <a href="http://www.jelena-diakonikolas.com/" target="_blank">Jelena Diakonikolas</a>. In Spring 2021, I will work as Research Assistant supervised by Professor <a href="https://jessicisewskikehe.github.io/" target="_blank">Jessi Cisewski Kehe</a>.
